# Fetching

Fetching data from the API with Asteria is pretty simple, it works just like this:

```ts
import Asteria from 'asteriasdk';

const asteria = new Asteria({
  collectAnonStats: true // Allows us to gather some usage data for improvments
  usedURL: "https://api.asteria.nexusfn.net" // This setting is only optional, but you can provide your own api if you'd like, it will have to be 1:1 with ours though
  throwErrors: true //Enables/Disables error throwing. This setting is optional
})

Available keys:
- name
- id
- description

//Getting a cosmetic by name
const cosmetic = await asteria.getCosmetic("name", "Black Knight", false); //The first argument is the key, the second is the value of your key

console.log(`Cosmetic is ${cosmetic.name}`) // --> "Cosmetic is Black Knight"

//The same way goes for every other function

const poi = await asteria.getPoi("name", "MEGA CITY", false); //The first argument is the key, the second is the value of your key

console.log(`POI is ${poi.name}`) // --> "Playlist is MEGA CITY"

const playlist = await asteria.getPlaylist("name", "Solo", false); //The first argument is the key, the second is the value of your key

console.log(`Playlist id is ${playlist.id}`) // --> "Playlist id is XXX"

```
