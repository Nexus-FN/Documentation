# First steps for the SDK

The SDK is written in TypeScript, but can be used in any JavaScript project. It is recommended to use TypeScript, as it will provide you with type definitions and a better development experience.

## Installation

## THIS IS NOT NEEDED FOR Momentum TO WORK

### Install the SDK with the Node Package Manager of your choice

```bash
npm install momentumsdk
pnpm install momentumsdk
yarn add momentumsdk
```

### Import the SDK

```typescript
import Momentum from 'momentumsdk';
```

### Generate a new API key

Execute the `/createkey` command in your Discord server to generate a new API key. It will be sent to you in a ephemeral message, so only you can see it. If you lose it, you can always generate a new one.
### Create a new instance of the SDK

```typescript
import Momentum from 'momentumsdk';

const momentum = new Momentum({
    url: "https://apollo.nexusfn.net/api/", //Replace with your own URL
    apikey: "APIKEY" //Replace with your own generated API key
});
```

Great job! You've now installed the SDK and created a new instance of it. Now you can start using the SDK to interact with the API.
