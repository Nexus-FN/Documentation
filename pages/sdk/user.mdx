# User

#### Getting a user from the database

TypeScript will automatically infer the type of the user object, which makes it easier to understand which keys are available as well as what values the output will have.

Keys are the column names in the database, values are the values in the database.

Possible keys are:
- accountId
- username
- email
- createdAt
- discordId

###### Example:

```typescript
const user = await momentum.getUser("username", "Zetax");

console.log(user.username)
```

#### Updating a user in the database. Same keys as above.
```typescript
const updatedUser = await momentum.updateUser("username", "Zetax", "email", "newemail@gmail.com");

console.log(updatedUser.email)
```
