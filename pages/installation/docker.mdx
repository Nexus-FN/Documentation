### Installation using Docker

While the installation may look hard and complex, it's actually really simple and takes about 5-10 minutes, I will make a Youtube Tutorial about it soon though.

#### Requirements

- Upstash Redis (Optional but recommended) [Find out how to create a redis database here](https://docs.upstash.com/redis), it's really simple.
- NodeJS Download [here](https://nodejs.org/en)
- NPM (Automatically installed when installing NodeJS)
- Discord Bot [Create one here](https://discord.com/developers/)
- Cloudflare R2 Bucket / S3 Bucket (Soon Optional) [Find out how to create one here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/get-started/)

#### Using Docker (Recommended)

Create an `.env` file with the following contents:

```env
MONGO_URI="mongodb://127.0.0.1/momentum" # Should be the connection URI for your MongoDB database.
BOT_TOKEN="" # The token for your Discord bot.
CLIENT_ID="" # The client ID for your Discord bot.
GUILD_ID="" # Your Discord servers guild ID
GLOBALCHAT_ENABLED=true # Set to true if you want to enable global chat.
NAME="" # The name of your backend. Name it anything you want. Dont use special characters or spaces.
PORT=8080 # The port you want your backend to run on.
GAME_SERVERS="127.0.0.1:8080_192.168.178:7777" # The IP addresses of your game servers. Separate them with underscores (_) !IMPORTANT!
ALLOW_REBOOT=true # Set to true if you want to allow the reboot launcher to be able to use auto login for headless game servers

# Advanced settings below (only change if you know what you're doing)

MATCHMAKER_IP="127.0.0.1:80" # The URL for your matchmaker.
USE_S3=false # Set to true if you want to use S3 for file storage. Requires more setup
S3_BUCKET_NAME="" # The name of your S3 bucket. Only needed if USE_S3 is true.
S3_ENDPOINT="" # The endpoint of your S3 bucket. Only needed if USE_S3 is true.
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID="" # The access key ID for your S3 bucket. Only needed if USE_S3 is true.
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="" # The secret access key for your S3 bucket. Only needed if USE_S3 is true.
USE_REDIS = false # Set to true if you want to use Redis for caching and token storing. Requires more setup
REDIS_TOKEN = "" # The token for your Redis database. Only needed if USE_REDIS is true.
REDIS_URL = "" # The URL for your Redis database. Only needed if USE_REDIS is true.
```

Pull the Docker image using the following command:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/nexus-fn/momentum
```

Then run the Docker image using the following command:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -p 80:80 --env-file .env nexus-fn/momentum:main
```
